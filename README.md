first of all this is not a virus even though windows defender might say so and i am not responsible for how you use this at any means i just created these tools for you guys and i did not mean it for you guys to use this harmfully and the ip addresses listed in the .bat file i got permission from the people to get their ip address and use it and post it its not my fault/responsibility if you use those ip addresses and boot them/kick them offline at ANY means so with that said Enjoy :) 


psstt the multi tool has 4 tools first calculator second a password generator third ip pinger and fourth get your own ip details
you have to choose calculator or password gen first then when ur done press enter to go to more options :)
